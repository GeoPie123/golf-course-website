----------Project Description----------
This website presents four of the world’s most famous golf courses: Augusta National, Cypress Point, Pine Valley, and St Andrews. The project contains five total pages (a home page plus one page for each course), along with a navigation sidebar and consistent styling using an external CSS file.

----------Graphics Used----------
All photographs used in this project were sourced from online publications. No graphics or images were created by me. Below are the sources for each photo included in the website:

All other design elements—including the navigation bar, page layout, colors, and styling—were created manually by us using HTML and CSS. No graphics generators or automated design tools were used.

----------Additional Work Beyond Baseline----------
I created a complete five-page multi-view website with a cohesive layout, individually formatted course pages, and original textual descriptions for each course. While the site does not use responsive web design, I ensured proper page structure, consistent formatting, clean navigation between pages, and a polished visual presentation that goes beyond a single-page basic layout.
