            <h2>Cypress Point Club</h2>
            <p>
                Cypress Point is located on the Monterey Peninsula in California. Designed by Alister MacKenzie,
                it is known for its dramatic coastal setting, with holes that play through dunes, forest, and along
                cliffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean.
            </p>

            <p>
                The course feels natural and flowing, with holes that follow the land rather than fighting it. The
                routing takes players through different environments, building toward a famous stretch along the
                shoreline on the back nine.
            </p>

            <h3>Signature Stretch</h3>
            <p>
                The closing holes on the back nine are some of the most photographed in golf. One par 3 plays across
                a rocky cove to a green set on the edge of the ocean, capturing the challenge and beauty of coastal golf.
            </p>

            <h3>Why It Is Considered Top Tier</h3>
            <p>
                Cypress Point is often praised for its combination of scenery, variety, and shot–making demands. It is
                short by modern championship standards, but the wind, angles, and elevation changes keep it interesting
                for all levels of players.
