            <h2>Cypress Point Club</h2>
            <p>
                Cypress Point is located on the Monterey Peninsula in California. Designed by Alister MacKenzie,
                it is known for its dramatic coastal setting, with holes that play through dunes, forest, and along
                cliffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean.
            </p>

            <p>
                The course feels natural, with holes that follow the land rather than feeling artificially made. The
                routing takes players through different environments, building toward a famous stretch along the
                shoreline on the back nine. In terms of course difficulty, it is rated at a 73.1/141. 
            </p>

            <h3>Signature Stretch</h3>
            <p>
                The closing holes on the back nine are some of the most photographed in golf. One par 3 plays across
                a rocky cove to a green set over the ocean, capturing the challenge and beauty of coastal golf. Hole 16 is a 233 yard par 3 
                that boasts a challenge to golfers of all levels, even the most elite. With a force carry of over 200 yards, a poor shot
                is almost an automatic bogey.
            </p>

            <h3>Why It Is Considered Top Tier</h3>
            <p>
                Cypress Point is often praised for its combination of scenery, variety, and shot–making demands. It is
                considered short by modern standards, but the wind, angles, and elevation changes keep it interesting
                for even the highest level of players.
