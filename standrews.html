            <h2>St Andrews (Old Course)</h2>
            <p>
                The Old Course at St Andrews, in Scotland, is often called the “Home of Golf.” The game has been played
                on this land for centuries, and the course has evolved gradually rather than being created all at once
                by a modern architect.
            </p>

            <p>
                The layout is links golf: firm turf, rolling ground, and deep bunkers that punish inaccurate shots.
                Many holes share large double greens, and the wind off the North Sea plays a major role in how the
                course feels from day to day.

            <h3>Historic Moments</h3>
            <p>
                The Old Course has hosted many major championships and memorable finishes. The closing holes near the
                town, including the walk over the Swilcan Bridge on the 18th, are iconic scenes in golf.
            </p>

            <h3>Why It Is Considered Top Tier</h3>
            <p>
                St Andrews is admired for its history, strategy, and unique features. The course offers multiple ways
                to play each hole, asking players to think about angles, ground contours, and the wind. It shows how
                golf can be challenging without relying solely on length.
