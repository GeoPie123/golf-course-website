            <h2>St Andrews (Old Course)</h2>
            <p>
                The Old Course at St Andrews, in Scotland, is often called the “Home of Golf.” This is because St Andrews is often 
                considered the oldest course in golf. It dates back to the 15th century and has been a staple of golf for centuries.
                There was no single course designer, but we can thank Old Tom Morris for most of the contributions.
            </p>

            <p>
                This golf course is different from the others as it's a links style golf course meaning firm fairways, 
                windy conditions, and deep bunkers that punish inaccurate shots. Many holes share large double greens and the 
                wind and firm conditions play a pivotal role in how the golf course plays day to day.

            <h3>Historic Moments</h3>
            <p>
                The Old Course has hosted many major championships including many of which with memorable finishes.
                The closing holes are unique in the sense that they are adjacent to the town with one tee shot where 
                you can even take it over a town building. Other famous spots on this cousre include the walk over 
                the Swilcan Bridge on the 18th (a popular spot for tourists).

            <h3>Why It Is Considered Top Tier</h3>
            <p>
                St Andrews is admired for its history, strategy, and unique features. The course offers multiple ways
                to play each hole, asking players to think about angles, ground contours, and the wind. It shows the many 
                different things that make golf challenging.
