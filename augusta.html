            <p>
                Augusta National is located in Augusta, Georgia and is home to the Masters Tournament, one of golf’s
                four major championships for professional men’s golf. In recent years, it has also been the home to ANWA,
                the most prestigous women's amateur event. Augusta was designed by Bobby Jones and Alister MacKenzie and
                opened in the 1930s.
            </p>

            <p>
                The layout is famous for its carefully shaped fairways, contoured greens, and dramatic risk–reward
                opportunities. Flowering dogwoods, azaleas, and pines frame many holes, creating a distinctive look
                that viewers recognize instantly during Masters week. As for difficulty, the course is so prestigous that
                it does not have an official slope and course rating, but it is estimated at 77.5/145.

            <ul>
                <li><strong>12th hole (Golden Bell)</strong> &mdash; a short par 3 guarded by Rae’s Creek and swirling winds.</li>
                <li><strong>13th hole (Azalea)</strong> &mdash; a par 5 that tempts long hitters to go for the green in two.</li>
                <li><strong>16th hole (Redbud)</strong> &mdash; a par 3 with a green that slopes toward a pond, often setting up dramatic shots on Sunday.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why It Is Considered Top Tier</h3>
            <p>
                Many golfers consider Augusta National one of the finest courses in the world because it combines
                strategy and precision with a stunning backdrop, while hosting the most prestigous golf tournament in the world.
                The design rewards risky but methodical shots and punishes careless mistakes, especially around the greens.
