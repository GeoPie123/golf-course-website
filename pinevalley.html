            <h2>Pine Valley Golf Club</h2>
            <p>
                Pine Valley is located in New Jersey and is frequently ranked as one of the most demanding courses
                in the world. The design features wide variety: long and short holes, uphill and downhill shots,
                and greens that require accurate approaches.
            </p>

            <p>
                The course is known for its rugged look, with sandy waste areas, native vegetation, and carefully
                placed bunkers. Many holes require players to carry their tee shots or approaches over hazards to
                reach the fairway or green.

            <h3>Challenge and Strategy</h3>
            <p>
                Pine Valley is considered a complete test of golf. There are few “easy” holes, but the design is fair:
                good shots are rewarded and poor shots quickly lead to trouble. The greens and surrounding areas add
                another layer of difficulty, requiring imagination and touch.
            </p>

            <h3>Why It Is Considered Top Tier</h3>
            <p>
                Golfers and course raters admire Pine Valley for its consistency. Almost every hole is strong, and
                the course demands focus from the first tee to the final green. Its combination of shot values and
                character makes it a benchmark for golf course design.
