            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>
                This website introduces four golf courses that are widely considered among most as the best in the world:
                <strong>Augusta National</strong>, <strong>Cypress Point</strong>, <strong>Pine Valley</strong>, and
                <strong>St Andrews (Old Course)</strong>. The goal of this website is to give a short preview of each course, not to rank them.
            </p>

            <p>
                Golf course rankings change over time, but these four names are almost always consistently near the top of any
                list. They combine all different aspects of the game in ways that have shaped how golfers and architects
                think about the game.
            </p>
