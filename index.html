            <p>
                This website introduces four golf courses that are widely considered among the best in the world:
                <strong>Augusta National</strong>, <strong>Cypress Point</strong>, <strong>Pine Valley</strong>, and
                <strong>St Andrews (Old Course)</strong>. The goal is not to rank them, but to give a brief look at
                what makes each place unique.
            </p>

            <p>
                Golf course rankings change over time, but these four names almost always appear near the top of any
                list. They combine history, strategy, and scenery in a way that has shaped how golfers and architects
                think about the game.
